The result is a folder contains what now we can get from the code ||
The cleaned_data.csv is to contain the after being cleaned data ||
The Cleaned_termi_data is used to kick off the fucking-off data written by our half-hearted students ||
While the Data_visualization is to see the origin data ||
And u have to know that the two "from to" kids are to change your format ||
model_establishment u can just see its function from seeing its title, ahh ||
and the next two ones also follows the situation. ||
However u have to know that the preprocessing_cleaned.xlsx is just the xlsx format cleaned_data.csv! ||

Okayï¼Œ now I have given u a new way to enlarge our dataset we will use KDE and throw all the nums now we can calculate to it ||
However, what I represent here is just an ambiguous algorithm which i just throw the whole data nums to it ||
what u can improve is to calculate more data according to the specific question u wanna convey ||
ANd also u can change my value of KDE to fit your question ||
In general, it has been finished ,though after data_reform the dataset went worse enough like poof...
